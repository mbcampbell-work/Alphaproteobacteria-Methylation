This repository is organized into three self-contained subfolders, each dedicated to a specific aspect of our methylation analysis project. 
Users can individually download each subfolder based on their needs. Below is a brief overview of the contents within each subfolder:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
IGV:
  Purpose: Visualization of methylation calls.
  Content: Includes a standalone IGV package for visualization of methylation data in Brucella strains or Caulobacter strains.

Shells for Nanopore Methylation:
  Purpose: Processing of raw Nanopore sequencing data.
  Content: Features three scripts designed to handle and process the raw Nanopore data for this study. (Works with R9.5 and R10.4.1 data)

RCode:
  Purpose: Data processing and figure generation of nanopore methylation data
  Content: Contains R code for post-processing of R9.5 data and including scripts for creating main figures and supplementary materials for {link to paper}.

Each subfolder includes a detailed README for guidance on usage and requirements. Please refer to the respective README file within each subfolder for more specific instructions.
